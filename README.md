# Books Bazaar E-Commerce Store
## Milestone Project 5
The aim of this project is to build a full-stack web application using Django (the full-stack Python framework), HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
- This e-commerce web application is a fictional online book store.
- The functionality included in this web application includes, but is not limited to
    - An e-commerce store
    - Payments with [Stripe](https://stripe.com)
    - A book reviews area
    - A contact form for customer enquiries
    - Confirmation emails being sent to the user
    - CRUD functionality for the application admin users to manage products
    - An admin area for application admin users to manage book reviews, orders, users and view customer enquiries
        - I have included admin credentials in the project submission for assessors to log in
- This web application was built for educational purposes and no orders that are placed will be fulfilled.
- The Stripe payments implementation is set up for testing purposes only. No payments will be taken from users' accounts and users should not input their real debit or credit card details.
    - For completing purchases the below credit card details should be used:
        - Card number: 4242 4242 4242 4242 or 4000 0025 0000 3155 (Will prompt for purchase verification)
        - Any date in the future
        - Any CVV security number
